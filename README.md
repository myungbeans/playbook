![Playbook Opening Sequnece](http://www.giphy.com/gifs/2gVZiyyHbTsy6XLSh6)

A virtual playbook for coaches, drill directors, and dancers to map and visualize synchronized movement in action. Users can log-in to create or view all of their saved plays, drag and drop to edit player's positions, set travel paths/routes for each player, and hit play to see all of the players move along their routes.

Built on a React-Redux front end and Ruby on Rails back end. Playbook uses JSON Web Tokens to verify authorization and BCrypt to protect user passwords.
